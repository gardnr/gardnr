Part 7: MQTT
=================================

GARDNR comes with a built-in [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) subscriber for logging metrics. In order to use the subscriber, it must be connected to a broker, such as (Mosquitto)[https://mosquitto.org/].

Use the metric name as the topic and the log value as the message.
