Part 5: Grows
=============

Grow models are used to group metric logs into a collection, ideally for the duration of a single crop cycle. Grows consist of a start and end time. To start a grow, run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ gardnr grow start

This will create an active grow until the grow is ended. Having an active grow also enables the use of triggers, which is described in :doc:`tutorial06`
